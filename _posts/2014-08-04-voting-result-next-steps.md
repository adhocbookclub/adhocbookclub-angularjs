##Reading List

Congratulations! If yours didn't get picked, it's okay, we can reuse your nominations for next time if you wish! <sup>[1]</sup>

##Voting Results - Breakdown
Because we value transparency and data visualization (plus playing around with Excel is kind of fun), we have provided a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wtxlupm023318rh/Voting%20Results.pdf" target="_blank">detailed report</a> for you all to audit. Here's a brief explanation of the graphs:

1. **Table**: Individual (and anonymous) votes are tabulated and averaged to give us the rankings.
2. **Average Book Rating**: Self-explanatory, bar graphs are always reliable to get the job done.
3. **Average Voter Rating**: This details the tendency for a voter to give higher or lower scores. For example, Voter #13 gave the highest ratings on average, while Voter #6 was quite harsh. :P
4. **Voter Tendencies**: This breaks down the previous graph by looking at voter ratings for all 21 books. Please note that the y-axis is stacked/not scaled.
5. **Total Book Score x Voter Ratings**: Since there are 14 voters, the maximum score a book can receive is 140 points. This graph analyzes ratings from each voter that make up the total score for each book.
6. **Book Rating Pie Chart**: The pie puts into perspective how each book fared compared to the rest. As you can see, it was a very tight competition!

##Next Steps
###Book Acquisition

We love e-reading, and to make this book club as accessible as possible, soft copies of all texts are available in three formats: pdf, epub (apple and android), and mobi (kindle). They will be stored in our <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fbdpm9j8cnixxov/AAD519xohfJmaYhIxmlRQuh3a" target="_blank">communal dropbox folder</a>, along with anything else relevant to our readings. **If you would like access, please contact us with your dropbox account email so we can add you.** However if you're faithful to hard copies, your best best will be Amazon or your local library.

###Discussion Leaders
We'd like to have 1-2 people take charge of leading discussions. This role isn't significantly different from being a participant - you just have to do more close reading and come up with a couple of discussion questions or relevant supplementary material to enhance and give structure to the conversation. Although anyone can volunteer, we will give a special nudge to those who nominated, or gave a high rating to these books--you've shown a great amount of interest, right? ;) **If you would like to lead the discussion for any of these books, please let us know!**

###Reading Schedule
Looking ahead, let's **finish our first book, *Underground*, by SUNDAY, AUGUST 24TH.** We will have exactly three weeks, which should be manageable given the book's relatively short length of 309 pages. We will send out a poll during the last week to decide on a good time for our Google Hangout discussion, which is likely to take place during the last weekend of August. Mark your calendars!

It's fantastic to have all of you on board, and we are soooo thrilled to finally get started!

<sup>[1]</sup> Story of the day: *Lord of Light* was a repeat nomination from last summer, where it got second to last place. This time, it got second place! And I quote Samuel Beckett, "Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better." ;)
