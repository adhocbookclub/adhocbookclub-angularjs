    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>A powerful, tender story of race and identity by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the award-winning author of <cite>Half of a Yellow Sun.</cite></p>
    <p>Ifemelu and Obinze are young and in love when they depart military-ruled Nigeria for the West. Beautiful, self-assured Ifemelu heads for America, where despite her academic success, she is forced to grapple with what it means to be black for the first time. Quiet, thoughtful Obinze had hoped to join her, but with post-9/11 America closed to him, he instead plunges into a dangerous, undocumented life in London. Fifteen years later, they reunite in a newly democratic Nigeria, and reignite their passion&mdash;for each other and for their homeland.</p>

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>Widely held as a work of genius, <cite>The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</cite> is the novel that first brought him to the forefront of the international literary scene. Rich in stories, characters and imaginative range, it was written while Kundera was still forbidden to publish in his home country of Czechoslovakia, which was then behind the Iron Curtain. In seven wonderfully integrated parts, different aspects of modern existence from the posthumous erasure of 'enemies' of communism from the historical record, to the subtle agony of the fading memory of a lost love, to the bizarre sexlessnes of modern promiscuity are explored with boldness, subversive humor and the magical power of fiction.</p>

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>With only a yellowing photograph in hand, a young man&mdash;also named Jonathan Safran Foer&mdash;sets out to find the woman who may or may not have saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Accompanied by an old man haunted by memories of the war; an amorous dog named Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior; and the unforgettable Alex, a young Ukrainian translator who speaks in a sublimely butchered English, Jonathan is led on a quixotic journey over a devastated landscape and into an unexpected past.</p>
    <p>By turns comic and tragic, but always passionate, wildly inventive, and touched with an indelible humanity, this debut novel is a powerful, deeply felt story of searching: for the past, family, and truth.</p>

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>Only by inhabiting Dao (the Way of Nature) and dwelling in its unity can humankind achieve true happiness and freedom, in both life and death. This is Daoist philosophy's central tenet, espoused by the person&mdash;or group of people&mdash;known as Zhuangzi (369?-286? BCE) in a text by the same name. To be free, individuals must discard rigid distinctions between right and wrong, and follow a course of action not motivated by gain or striving. When one ceases to judge events as good or bad, man-made suffering disappears, and natural suffering is embraced as part of life. <cite>Zhuangzi</cite> elucidates this mystical philosophy through humor, parable, and anecdote, using non sequitur and even nonsense to illuminate truths beyond the boundaries of ordinary logic. Boldly imaginative and inventively written, the <cite>Zhuangzi</cite> floats free of its historical period and society, addressing the spiritual nourishment of all people across time.</p>

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>This classic novel of self-discovery has inspired generations of seekers. With parallels to the enlightenment of the Buddha, Hesse's <cite>Siddhartha</cite> is the story of a young Brahmin's quest for the ultimate reality. His quest takes him from the extremes of indulgent sensuality to the rigors of ascetism and self-denial. At last he learns that wisdom cannot be taught&mdash;it must come from one's own experience and inner struggle. Steeped in the tenets of both psychoanalysis and Eastern mysticism, <cite>Siddhartha</cite> presents a strikingly original view of man and culture, and the arduous process of self-discovery that leads to reconciliation, harmony, and peace.</p>

    <p>A dreamlike novel, <cite>Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</cite> is split between parallel narratives. The odd-numbered chapters take place in the "Hard-Boiled Wonderland​". The narrator is a "Calcutec", a human data processor/encryption system who has been trained to use his subconscious as an encryption key.​ The even-numbered chapters deal with a newcomer to "The End of the World", a strange, isolated Town purportedly surrounded by a perfect and impenetrable wall. The narrator is in the process of being accepted into the Town​, but there is something eerily disquieting about its changeless nature and fable-like inhabitants. The two storylines converge, exploring concepts of consciousness, the unconscious mind, and identity.</p>

The nine stories in this stunning debut collection unerringly chart the emotional journeys of characters seeking love beyond the barriers of nations and generations. Imbued with the sensual details of Indian culture, they speak with passion and wisdom to everyone who has ever felt like a foreigner.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Haunted by the myth of Cupid and Psyche throughout his life, C.S. Lewis wrote this, his last, extraordinary novel, to retell their story through the gaze of Psyche’s sister, Orual. Disfigured and embittered, Orual loves her younger sister to a fault and suffers deeply when she is sent away to Cupid, the God of the Mountain. Psyche is forbidden to look upon the god’s face, but is persuaded by her sister to do so; she is banished for her betrayal. Orual is left alone to grow in power but never in love, to wonder at the silence of the gods. Only at the end of her life, in visions of her lost beloved sister, will she hear an answer.</p>

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>It was a clear spring day, Monday, March 20, 1995, when five members of the religious cult Aum Shinrikyo conducted chemical warfare on the Tokyo subway system using sarin, a poison gas twenty-six times as deadly as cyanide. The unthinkable had happened, a major urban transit system had become the target of a terrorist attack.</p>
    <p>In an attempt to discover why, Haruki Murakami, internationally acclaimed author of <cite>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</cite> and arguably Japan’s most important contemporary novelist, talked to the people who lived through the catastrophe—from a Subway Authority employee with survivor guilt, to a fashion salesman with more venom for the media than for the perpetrators, to a young cult member who vehemently condemns the attack though he has not quit Aum. Through these and many other voices, Murakami exposes intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche. And as he discerns the fundamental issues leading to the attack, we achieve a clear vision of an event that could occur anytime, anywhere. Hauntingly compelling and inescapably important, <cite>Underground</cite> is a powerful work of journalistic literature from one of the world’s most perceptive writers.</p>

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>Toru, a quiet and preternaturally serious young college student in Tokyo, is devoted to Naoko, a beautiful and introspective young woman, but their mutual passion is marked by the tragic death of their best friend years before.  Toru begins to adapt to campus life and the loneliness and isolation he faces there, but Naoko finds the pressures and responsibilities of life unbearable.  As she retreats further into her own world, Toru finds himself reaching out to others and drawn to a fiercely independent and sexually liberated young woman.</p>
    <p>A poignant story of one college student's romantic coming-of-age, <cite>Norwegian Wood</cite> takes us to that distant place of a young man's first, hopeless, and heroic love.</p>

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>The groundbreaking trans-genre work of Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) has been insinuating itself into the structure, stance, and very breath of world literature for well over half a century. Multi-layered, self-referential, elusive, and allusive writing is now frequently labeled Borgesian. Umberto Eco's international bestseller, <cite>The Name of the Rose</cite>, is, on one level, an elaborate improvisation on Borges' fiction "The Library," which American readers first encountered in the original 1962 New Directions publication of <cite>Labyrinths</cite>.</p>
    <p>This new edition of <cite>Labyrinths</cite>, the classic representative selection of Borges' writing edited by Donald A. Yates and James E. Irby (in translations by themselves and others), includes the text of the original edition (as augmented in 1964) as well as Irby's biographical and critical essay, a poignant tribute by André Maurois, and a chronology of the author's life. Borges enthusiast William Gibson has contributed a new introduction bringing Borges' influence and importance into the twenty-first century.</p>

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>A young woman is in love with a successful surgeon, a man torn between his love for her and his incorrigible womanizing. His mistress, a free-spirited artist, lives her life as a series of betrayals--while her other lover, earnest, faithful, and good, stands to lose everything because of his noble qualities. In a world where lives are shaped by irrevocable choices and fortuitous events, and everything occurs but once, existence seems to lose its substance, its weight. Hence we feel "the unbearable lightness of being."</p>
    <p>A major achievement from one of the world's truly great writers, Milan Kundera's magnificent novel of passion and politics, infidelity and ideas, encompasses the extremes of comedy and tragedy, illuminating all aspects of human existence.</p>
