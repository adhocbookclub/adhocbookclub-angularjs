<p class="lead">Here are some Frequently...Anticipated (?) Questions concerning the voting process, since we haven't really received any. Nevertheless, if you have any further enquiries, please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>

    <h3 class="panel-title">I've already read a book (or several books) on the list. How should I vote?</h3>

    Up to you. If you hated it the first time, feel free to give it a 1-rating in hopes that it'll get weeded out. But if you liked it, consider the benefits of rereading. It'll be less work for you, you'll be in an ideal place to lead the discussion, and as Nabokov once said, <em>one cannot read a book; one can only reread it</em>.

  <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">Isn't it unfair that this isn't by anonymous ballot?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    Proponents of the secret ballot might say so, but in this case, the need for accountability (i.e., a way for us to chase down people who haven't voted) outweighs the benefits (since intimidation from us was never really a major risk). Plus, the nominations have no name attached to them, and neither will the published results, so our current system seems good enough.

  <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">Can't Kathy or Jenny just rig this election since they have access to everyone's responses?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    All is fair in love, war, and book clubs. JK, but really, we will keep ballots anonymous until our ballots are submitted, and won't adjust our ratings in response to yours in order to swing things our way&mdash;so rest assured it's fair.

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">When will we find out the results?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    Assuming all ballots are in on time, we will disclose a full voting summary the weekend after the deadline, along with a proposed reading list and schedule. However, it is the holiday season, so an extension may happen if many of us are travelling. Regardless, we'll keep you updated!
