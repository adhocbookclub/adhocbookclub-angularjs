    <h3 class="nomination-heading">1984 <small>George Orwell</small></h3>
    <p>You know those books that you should have read at some point in college or maybe senior year of high school, but never did? This is one of those books. No doubt it is a classic and millions of people have read it­ so let's see what the big deal is!</p>
    <p>From the original NYT review in 1949: ''Nineteen Eighty­four,'' the most contemporary novel of this year and
who knows of how many past and to come, is a great examination into and dramatization of Lord Acton's
famous apothegm, ''Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.''</p>
