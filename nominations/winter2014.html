      <p>The book's central character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is an educated, but slothful 30-year-old man living with his mother in the Uptown neighborhood of early-1960s New Orleans who, in his quest for employment, has various adventures with colorful French Quarter characters. These include Miss Trixie, the octogenarian assistant accountant at Levi Pants; inept, wan Patrolman Mancuso; Darlene, the Bourbon Street stripper with a penchant for poultry; and Jones, the jivecat in space-age dark glasses. The novel serves as an outlandish but believable tribute to a city defined by its parade of eccentric denizens.</p>

      <p>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</p>

      <p>A dreamlike novel, <cite>Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</cite> is split between parallel narratives. The odd-numbered chapters take place in the "Hard-Boiled Wonderland​". The narrator is a "Calcutec", a human data processor/encryption system who has been trained to use his subconscious as an encryption key.​ The even-numbered chapters deal with a newcomer to "The End of the World", a strange, isolated Town purportedly surrounded by a perfect and impenetrable wall. The narrator is in the process of being accepted into the Town​, but there is something eerily disquieting about its changeless nature and fable-like inhabitants. The two storylines converge, exploring concepts of consciousness, the unconscious mind, and identity.</p>

      <p>Fondly yet sharply drawn, Wolff's characters stumble over each other in their baffled yet resolute search for the "right path."</p>

      <p>With accomplished precision and gentle eloquence, Lahiri traces the crosscurrents set in motion when immigrants, expatriates, and their children arrive, quite literally, at a cultural divide. A young couple faces the heartbreak of a stillborn birth while their Boston neighborhood copes with a nightly blackout. An Indian American girl recognizes her cultural identity during a Halloween celebration while the Pakistani civil war rages on television in the background. In the title story, an interpreter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonishing confession. The nine stories in this stunning debut collection unerringly chart the emotional journeys of characters seeking love beyond the barriers of nations and generations. Imbued with the sensual details of Indian culture, they speak with passion and wisdom to everyone who has ever felt like a foreigner.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-10 book-info">
      <p><cite>Invisible Cities</cite> details an imaginary conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, where the former shares with Khan several vignettes of cities in his empire. The majority of the book consists of brief prose poems describing 55 cities, apparently narrated by Polo. Short dialogues between the two characters are interspersed every five to ten cities and are used to discuss various ideas presented by the citieson a wide range of topics including linguistics and human nature. The book is structured around an interlocking pattern of numbered sections, while the length of each section’s title graphically outlines a continuously oscillating sine wave, or perhaps a city skyline. The interludes between Khan and Polo are no less poetically constructed than the cities, and form a framing device, a story within a story, that plays with the natural complexity of language and stories.</p>

      <p>Under the streets of London there's a place most people could never even dream of: a city of monsters and saints, murderers and angels, knights in armour and pale girls in black velvet. This is the city of the people who have fallen between the cracks of reality.</p>
      <p>Richard Mayhew is a plain businessman with a good heart&mdash;and an ordinary life that is changed forever on a day he stops to help a girl he finds bleeding on a London sidewalk. This single act of kindness catapults him out of his workday existence and into a world that is at once eerily familiar and utterly bizarre. A strange destiny awaits him beneath his native city, somewhere different, somewhere that is Neverwhere.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-10 book-info">
      <p><cite>The Periodic Table</cite> is largely a memoir of the years before and after Primo Levi’s transportation from his native Italy to Auschwitz as an anti-Facist partisan and a Jew. It recounts, in clear, precise, unfailingly beautiful prose, the story of the Piedmontese Jewish community from which Levi came, of his years as a student and young chemist at the inception of the Second World War, and of his investigations into the nature of the material world. As such, it provides crucial links and backgrounds, both personal and intellectual, in the tremendous project of remembrance that is Levi’s gift to posterity. But far from being a prologue to his experience of the Holocaust, Levi’s masterpiece represents his most impassioned response to the events that engulfed him. This novel celebrates the pleasures of love and friendship and the search for meaning, and stands as a monument to those things in us that are capable of resisting and enduring in the face of tyranny.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-10 book-info">
      <p>This classic novel of self-discovery has inspired generations of seekers. With parallels to the enlightenment of the Buddha, Hesse's <cite>Siddhartha</cite> is the story of a young Brahmin's quest for the ultimate reality. His quest takes him from the extremes of indulgent sensuality to the rigors of ascetism and self-denial. At last he learns that wisdom cannot be taught&mdash;it must come from one's own experience and inner struggle. Steeped in the tenets of both psychoanalysis and Eastern mysticism, <cite>Siddhartha</cite> presents a strikingly original view of man and culture, and the arduous process of self-discovery that leads to reconciliation, harmony, and peace.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-10 book-info">
      <p>This watershed work records Claude Lévi-Strauss's search for "a human society reduced to its most basic expression." From the Amazon basin through the dense upland jungles of Brazil, Lévi-Strauss found the societies he was seeking among the Caduveo, Bororo, Nambikwara, and Tupi-Kawahib. More than merely recounting his time in their midst, <cite>Tristes Tropiques</cite> places the cultural practices of these peoples in a global context and extrapolates a fascinating theory of culture that has given the book an importance far beyond the fields of anthropology and continental philosophy. The author's fresh approach, sense of humor, and openness to the sensuous mystique of the tropics make the scientific thrust of the book eminently accessible.</p>
