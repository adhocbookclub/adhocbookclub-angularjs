    <p>You know those books that you should have read at some point in college or maybe senior year of high school, but never did? This is one of those books. No doubt it is a classic and millions of people have read it&mdash;so let's see what the big deal is!</p>
    <p>From the original NYT review in 1949:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><cite>Nineteen Eighty-four</cite>, the most contemporary novel of this year and who knows of how many past and to come, is a great examination into and dramatization of Lord Acton's famous apothegm, "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely."</p>

    <p>I have always been meaning to read this book because of strong recommendations from my closest friends. <cite>The Alchemist</cite> is the masterpiece of Brazilian writer, Paulo Coelho, and is one of those dark horse books that suddenly took off and made the New York Times bestseller list for 300+ weeks.</p>
    <p>One Australian critic said:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Of books that I can recommend with the unshakable confidence of having read them and been entranced, impressed, entertained or moved, the universal gift is perhaps a limpid little fable called <cite>The Alchemist</cite>... In hauntingly spare prose, translated from the Brazilian original in Portuguese, it follows a young Andalusian shepherd into the desert on his quest for a dream and the fulfillment of his destiny.</p>

    <p>From a review on Goodreads:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Told from the perspective of a particularly insightful non-American, <cite>American Gods</cite> takes a long, hard look at how cultures and religions mesh, change, and fade in the states. How do Americans define and create faith? What gods does a godless nation&mdash;or maybe an excessively god-full nation&mdash;have with not even 300 years of national existence under its belt? With ghosts, murders, gods (both forgotten and barely worshiped), Gaiman weaves a tale that suspends previous conceptions of the American psyche, turns it up on its head, and makes you question, Who really is that homeless crazy in the subway station calling himself Mr. Wednesday?</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This book has the potential to throw you into an absolute revolution about how you accept yourself, what alienation from the "self" means, and a host of other themes on every aspect of adolescent development. Simply put&mdash;it has the power to let you know you're not alone.</p>

    <p>The magical ingredient behind this novel looks to be characterization, as many reviewers have praised on the memorable Cormoran Strike and his adept secretary, Robin.

  <div class="col-md-10 book-info">
    <p>Set in Paris, this novel weaves together two seemingly disparate lives. First, there is Renée, a concierge in a wealthy apartment building. Outwardly, she conforms to the dumpy, witless image her tenants have of the working class&mdash;all the while maintaining a rich inner life filled with philosophy, art, and culture. Second, there is Paloma, a precocious 12-year-old living in the same building where Renée works. Born into the elite, Paloma dreads the sybaritic, vacuous life that awaits her, and vows to commit suicide on her 13th birthday.</p>
    <p>Through alternating narration, the novel explores each character's individual musings, and gradually draws them together. This work promises to be an interesting window onto class, aesthetics, and the stark contrast that too often exists between our 'inner' and 'outer' lives.</p>

In 1962, five-year-old Olivia meets the half-sister she never knew existed, eighteen-year-old Kwan from China, who sees ghosts with her "yin eyes."

  <div class="col-md-10 book-info">
    <p>This is a book of short stories. As the cover of this book indicates, it has the Raymond Carver seal of approval. As the back cover of this book indicates, it has the Joyce Carol Oates and Anne Dillard seals of approval.</p>
    <p>Here's what the blurb on the back has to say about it:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Among the characters you'll find in this collection of twelve stories by Tobias Wolff are a teenage boy who tells morbid lies about his home life, a timid professor who, in the first genuine outburst of her life, pours out her opinions in spite of a protesting audience, a prudish loner who gives an obnoxious hitchhiker a ride, and an elderly couple on a golden anniversary cruise who endure the offensive conviviality of the ship's social director.</p>
      <p>Fondly yet sharply drawn, Wolff's characters stumble over each other in their baffled yet resolute search for the "right path."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Anyway, the first story in the collection and the titular story (the only ones I've read so far) are definitely solid. As far as I can tell from these two, Wolff likes to embed thematically illuminating secondary stories within his stories. It's quite exciting, since these secondary stories often bring in completely different kinds of subject matter: for example, in the first story, a couple listen to the sounds of their neighbors' dysfunctional home life, and then decide to watch a movie about a group of people getting killed off as they search for the city of gold, El Dorado. I suppose you could say that this technique is somewhat allegorical, since the secondary stories are chosen to contextualize the primary, surface-layer story; and it's really exciting to see how Wolff is able to combine totally different stories within one whole.</p>

      <p>Awarded the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Novel, and nominated for a Nebula Award in the same category, it tells of a rebellion on a planet whose original settlers, equipped with powerful abilities and advanced technology, keep most of society at a very primitive level, and rule the world as "gods" based upon the Hindu pantheon. They completely control the technology of re-incarnation which provides the opportunity for near-immortality for most people, but not always in such forms as they themselves would chose, and the rebellious are often re-incarnated in animal form. "Sam" (or "Kalkin" who is known by many names), one of the most powerful of "The First" sets out to change this situation.

    <p>Neil Gaiman is known for his wonderful interpretations of the fantasy genre. It's not quite like the Tolkien elves and dwarves, but rather a picture of our reality splashed with dazzling and peculiar elements. I've recently read <cite>Stardust</cite> and absolutely loved it, and I believe <cite>Neverwhere</cite> will be even more delightful.</p>
    <p>Danielle from Goodreads has more to say about this book:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><cite>Neverwhere</cite> is one of those books that answers the 'what if' question about the city in which you live your days, going through your admittedly 'mundane' routines. In this case, London. What if there was a London Below, a strange world which consists of Underground railways, tunnels, sewers, and sometimes uncannily parallels the London that the average inhabitant thought they knew but didn't, and in a way that seems a lot more interesting? It's a scary place, not terribly clean and sanitary. But it's also a place of wonders. If you spent some time there, would you find yourself, and realize that the normal world just doesn't hold the same charm for you, now that you've realized the possibilities? With this book, you can ponder these questions for yourself through the viewpoint of Richard Mayhew.</p>
      <p>The unknown is scary for us. Scary, but also exciting. You just have to find the courage to seek it out... Richard has to find that courage (the hard way), but he becomes a hero and a champion in his own right in the process of his journey. He faces pain, loss, and uncertainty, but he gains a lot more in return.</p>

    <p>The stories in the collection are amazing (with the first one as a possible exception, although I must admit that it's the only one that I've not read all the way through), and tend to focus on discontent people trying to find a way out of their current state of affairs. The best (in my opinion) quality of this collection is that in the third-person narration stories, the various writing styles and diction used are very representative of the characters. For example, one extremely insecure character's sections are loaded with qualifying phrases; a child constantly thinks about how his mother and her boyfriend would react to him doing certain things; another character attends a self-help seminar and adopts some of their language and capitalized jargon in his thoughts; swearing is actively avoided in a very religious person's sections.</p>
    <p>Anyway there's a lot more to say about why these stories are awesome, so let's read them!</p>

      <p><cite>Three Kingdoms</cite> tells the story of the fateful last reign of the Han dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 220), when the Chinese empire was divided into three warring kingdoms. This decisive period in Chinese history became a subject of intense and continuing interest to historians, poets, and dramatists. Writing some 1,200 years later, the Ming author Luo Guanzhong drew on this rich literary heritage to fashion a sophisticated, compelling narrative that has become the Chinese national epic. Luo's novel offers a startling and unsparing view of how power is wielded, how diplomacy is conducted, and how wars are planned and fought; it has influenced the ways the Chinese think about power, diplomacy, and war even to this day. As important for Chinese culture as the Homeric epics have been for the West, this Ming dynasty masterpiece continues to be widely influential in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, and remains a great work of world literature.</p>

      <p>A beautiful philosophical novel by a Nobel Prize winner. It’s a story of a young Indian Brahmin’s pursuit of enlightenment. The setting is the time period of Gautama Buddha. The story is rich with philosophy, but the language is so lyrical and the narration so vivid that it is difficult to separate the poetry and the deep philosophy. One flows with the story as if flowing with a peaceful river. The author seems to conclude that no amount of second-hand knowledge and learning can give you the real sense of peace or happiness unless it is enlivened by real first-hand experience.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Only once in a great while does a writer come along who defies comparison&mdash;a writer so original he redefines the way we look at the world. Neal Stephenson is such a writer and <cite>Snow Crash</cite> is such a novel, weaving  virtual reality, Sumerian myth, and just about everything in between with a cool, hip  cyber-sensibility to bring us the gigantic thriller of the information age. In reality, Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza for Uncle Enzo's Cosa Nostra Inc., but it  the Metaverse he's a warrior prince. Plunging headlong into the enigma of a new computer virus that's striking down hackers everywhere, he races along the neon-lit streets on a search-and-destroy mission for the shadowy virtual villain threatening to bring about infocalypse. <cite>Snow Crash</cite> is a mind-altering romp through a future America so bizarre, so outrageous... you'll recognize it immediately.</p>

    <p>Most of us have read books about Greek gods, and we're used to all of them being perfect human beings, especially in the way they look (muscular men with rugged beards with slender and tall women, yes? anyone?). One of the most well-known stories is of <cite>Cupid and Psyche</cite>. But this book is from a viewpoint of a rather tragic being. She is the deformed and ugly sister of Psyche who has not been blessed with looks or love.</p>
    <p>I think this will be fun to dissect. The book has a ridiculous number of layers to it, which is why I don't think we will have trouble finding topics to talk about.</p>
    <p>Here's the blurb from Amazon:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Haunted by the myth of <cite>Cupid and Psyche</cite> throughout his life, C.S. Lewis wrote this, his last, extraordinary novel, to retell their story through the gaze of Psyche’s sister, Orual. Disfigured and embittered, Orual loves her younger sister to a fault and suffers deeply when she is sent away to Cupid, the God of the Mountain. Psyche is forbidden to look upon the god’s face, but is persuaded by her sister to do so; she is banished for her betrayal. Orual is left alone to grow in power but never in love, to wonder at the silence of the gods. Only at the end of her life, in visions of her lost beloved sister, will she hear an answer.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In March of 1995, agents of a Japanese religious cult attacked the Tokyo subway system with sarin, a gas twenty-six times as deadly as cyanide. Attempting to discover why, Murakami conducted hundreds of interviews with the people involved, from the survivors to the perpetrators to the relatives of those who died, and <cite>Underground</cite> is their story in their own voices. Concerned with the fundamental issues that led to the attack as well as these personal accounts, <cite>Underground</cite> is a document of what happened in Tokyo as well as a warning of what could happen anywhere. This is an enthralling and unique work of nonfiction that is timely and vital and as wonderfully executed as Murakami’s brilliant novels.</p>
