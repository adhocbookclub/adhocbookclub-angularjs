      <p>Awarded the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Novel, and nominated for a Nebula Award in the same category, it tells of a rebellion on a planet whose original settlers, equipped with powerful abilities and advanced technology, keep most of society at a very primitive level, and rule the world as "gods" based upon the Hindu pantheon. They completely control the technology of re-incarnation which provides the opportunity for near-immortality for most people, but not always in such forms as they themselves would chose, and the rebellious are often re-incarnated in animal form. "Sam" (or "Kalkin" who is known by many names), one of the most powerful of "The First" sets out to change this situation. Parts of an unmade film project for this novel were used as cover to rescue US officials from revolutionary Iran, in a CIA operation known as the Canadian Caper, which is the basis for the film <cite>Argo</cite>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Earth is long since dead. On a colony planet, a band of men has gained control of technology, made themselves immortal, and now rules their world as the gods of the Hindu pantheon. Only one dares oppose them: he who was once Siddhartha and is now Mahasamatman. Binder of Demons. Lord of Light.</p>
