  <h1>Voting: Winter 2014</h1>
  <p class="lead">Thank you for your nominations! We have a great selection of books on the shortlist, so we're excited to begin the voting process. If you are already familiar with our FAQ, then you may head over to our nominations and voting page! The ballot and detailed guidelines can be found there.

  <div class="row"><div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">

  <h3>Voting FAQ</h3>
  <p>Here are some Frequently...Anticipated (?) Questions concerning the voting process, since we haven't really received any. Nevertheless, if you have any further enquiries, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:mllesecretaire@gmail.com">reach out</a>!</p>

  <div class="well"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">
    <strong>I've already read a book or two on the list. How should I vote?</strong>
    <p>We still recommend you to follow the labels on our 1-5 scale. If you hated it the first time, or are not interested in reading it again, feel free to give it a 1-rating in hopes that it'll get weeded out. But if you liked it, consider the benefits of rereading. It'll be less work for you, you'll be in an ideal place to lead the discussion, and as Nabokov once said, <em>one cannot read a book; one can only reread it</em>.</p><br/>

    <strong>Isn't it unfair that this isn't done by anonymous ballot?</strong>
    <p>Proponents of the secret ballot might say so, but in this case, the need for accountability (i.e., a way for us to chase down people who haven't voted) outweighs the benefits, since intimidation from us was never really a major risk. Plus, the nominations have no name attached to them, and neither will the published results, so our current system seems good enough.</p>

  </div><div class="col-md-6">
    <strong>But Kathy or Jenny can just rig this election since they have access to all the responses?</strong>
    <p><a href="http://media.tumblr.com/a572c49912e07d5ffd76fddd060d19b4/tumblr_inline_mqgxd9RsAE1qz4rgp.gif" target="_blank">Ummmmmmm</a>...all is fair in love, war, and book clubs? Just kidding. But really, we will keep ballots anonymous until after ours are submitted, and won't adjust our ratings in response to yours in order to swing things our way&mdash;so rest assured it's fair.</p><br/>

    <strong>When will we find out the results?</strong>
    <p>Assuming all ballots are in on time, we will disclose a full voting summary the weekend after the deadline, along with a proposed reading list and schedule. However, it is the holiday season, so an extension may happen if many of us are travelling. Regardless, we'll keep you updated!</p>
