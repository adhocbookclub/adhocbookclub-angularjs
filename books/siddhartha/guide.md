* **Brahman**: "the unchanging reality amidst and beyond the world," "creative principle which lies realized in the whole world"
* **Ātman**: soul/inner-self, essence of an individual; "in order to attain liberation, a human being must acquire self-knowledge, which is to realize that one's true self (Ātman) is identical with the transcendent self, Brahman"

###Discussion Questions
<ol class="guide">
  <li>The protagonists in both *The Alchemist* and *Siddhartha* leave the comforts of home in search of spiritual transcendence (consciously or not). Are there any significant similarities or differences in their experiences? (e.g. motivation, source of guidance, paths taken, ultimate outcome, etc.)</li>

  <li>Is there a message? Is this a religious text? What did you gain, if anything, from reading this novel? What were your impressions of the story and its themes?</li>

  <li>Both the protagonist of the novel and the historical buddha are named Siddhartha. How do you think the journey of Siddhartha the protagonist compares with that of the historical buddha? What is the significance of the Hesse's decision in naming his character Siddhartha?</li>

      See Strong, pp. 7-36, 45-50, 52-55 for the sacred biography of the Buddha as told in sacred scriptures
    </div>

  <li> What do you make of Siddhartha's conversation with Gotama? Specifically:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>"There is nothing to opinions...but the teachings, you've heard from me, are no opinion, and their goal is not to explain the world to those who seek knowledge...their goal is salvation from suffering" (26)</li>
      <li>"nobody will obtain salvation by means of teachings! You will not be able to convey and say to anybody...what has happened to you in the hour of enlightenment! ...depart from all teachings and all teachers and to reach my goal by myself or to die" (27)
        <ol type="i">
          <li>What does this imply about Buddhism as a religion? How should a Buddhist consider the teachings of the Buddha? Empiricism vs. rationalism?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>"you know how to talk wisely, my friend. Be aware of too much wisdom!" (28)</li>

    </div>

  <li>Why does Siddhartha choose to partake in the world of material desires (Kamala: lust, love, Kamaswami: wealth, power)? Did this surprise you? Do you think this is the right decision? What do you think Siddhartha gain from this experience (transition from thinking, waiting, fasting to material obsession)?</li>

      <ul class="guide">
        <li>"As a lotus flower is born in water, grows in water and rise out of water to stand above it unsoiled, so I, born in the world, raised in the world and having overcome the world, live unsoiled by the world"</li>
        <li>See "Tantric Buddhism, or the Vajrayana" in Strong pp.206-220; except: "the mantrayanist should always practice true meditation by making devotional offerings of such things as feces, urine, and semen as well as snot...he should seize the property of others; he should have intercourse with their wives. He should tell lies; and he should kill all the Buddhas"</li>

  <li>Let's talk about the end of the novel.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Siddhartha's son leaves him behind to find his own life in the city. How did this event impact Siddhartha?</li>
      <li>What does Siddhartha learn from the river? What does he mean by the river's having all voices of the creatures/oneness? What about his denial of the concept of time?</li>
      <li>Govinda's conversation with Siddhartha: what is the difference between searching and finding? (98)</li>
      <li>Wisdom cannot be passed on. Cannot be expressed in words and taught. It just sounds like foolishness when one tries. (100)</li>
      <li>The opposite of every truth is just as true. Everything is one-sided which can be thought with thoughts and said with words. The world is never one-sided. A person is never entirely holy or entirely sinful. The sinner in times to come...will be Buddha. Things can be loved. But I cannot love words. (101-103)</li>
      <li>The stone is already everything, but it is also a stone today. (102)</li>

      <li>For classical sources on emptiness/nonduality (śūnyatā), see <a href="http://lapislazulitexts.com/longer_prajnaparamita_hrdaya_sutra.html" target="_blank"><em>Heart Sutra</em></a>, "Nargarjuna: Verses", Strong pp. 157-162, and <em>Vimalakirti Sutra</em>.</li>
      <li>Excerpt from <em>Vimalakirti Sutra</em>: Vimalakīrti remains silent while discussing the subject of emptiness with an assembly of bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas give a variety of answers on the question what non-duality is. Manjusri is the last bodhisattva to answer, and says that "by giving an explanation they have already fallen into dualism". Vimalakīrti, in his turn, answers with silence.</li>
      <li>Wikipedia on Nargarjun on the two truths doctrine in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: which claims that there are two levels of truth or reality in Buddhist teaching, the ultimate reality and the conventionally or superficial reality. The ultimate truth to Nagarjuna is the truth that everything is empty of essence, this includes emptiness itself ('the emptiness of emptiness') &ndash; Middle Way.</li>
      <li>Nargarjuna's use of catuṣkoṭi (here is an article that has a somewhat lucid explanation on the <a href="http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/logic-of-buddhist-philosophy/" target="_blank">catuṣkoṭi </a>) in his exposition of emptiness:</li>
      <blockquote>All things (dharma) exist: affirmation of being, negation of non-being<br/>
        All things (dharma) do not exist: affirmation of non-being, negation of being<br/>
        All things (dharma) both exist and do not exist: both affirmation and negation<br/>
        All things (dharma) neither exist nor do not exist: neither affirmation nor negation<br/>  
        Emptiness is none of the above. To say that all things are 'empty' is to deny any kind of ontological foundation.

      <li>Chan koans: A monk asked Dongshan Shouchu, "What is Buddha?" Dongshan said, "Three pounds of flax."</li>
      <li>A student asked Master Yun-Men (A.D. 949) "Not even a thought has arisen; is there still a sin or not?" Master replied, “Mount Sumeru!"</li>
      <li>Tiantai formulation: Three thousand realms in a single moment of thought:</li>
      <blockquote>Zhiyi taught the principle of Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought Moment (一念三千) in his "Great Concentration and Insight", based on the <em>Lotus Sutra</em>. The number 'Three Thousand' is derived from the Ten Worlds, multiplied by ten [because of the Mutual Possession of the Ten Worlds], which gives 100, multiplied by ten [the Ten Factors listed in Ch. 2 of the Lotus Sutra] which gives 1,000. 1,000 multiplied by 3 [the Three Realms of Existence: Self, Other, and Environment] which gives 3,000. - Wikipedia</blockquote>
