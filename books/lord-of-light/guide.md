1. Taraka insists that Sam deserves the title of "Lord of Light" (275). Sam claims that becoming the Buddha was merely a calculated choice. Do you think Sam experienced personal enlightenment in campaigning for his cause? Does it matter that he consciously rejects the beliefs he preaches? What is the role of religion for Sam? The mortals? The gods?
2. Is Sam justified in his use of deceit and trickery (mainly in relation to his preaching)? What is the significance of Rild, the disciple who genuinely converts to Samâ€™s religion?
3. The novel begins near the conclusion in chapter 1, but picks up in earnest at a time point in the past in chapter 2. Characters frequently change their names, bodies, and identities. Why do you think the novel is structured as such?
4. Discuss the role of Nirriti. What role does he play in the outcome of this novel?
5. Discuss the Sam-Kali-Yama love triangle. What role does it play in the novel? What do you think of the girl Murga at the conclusion of this novel?
6. How is the role of sex and gender presented in the novel?
7. The main subject of conflict revolves around class struggle (gods vs. mortals), accessibility of knowledge, and religious differences. How do you think the presentation of these themes in the novel reflect the issues of our society? Which side of the debate would you take?
8. Characters in the novel achieve immortality by body transfers. Would you consider this way of life immortality? Would you be interested in extending life in this manner?
9. As Sam points out, he could have chosen many other religions to begin his revolution. Why Buddhism?
