###Characters
* What are your thoughts on Richard as the protagonist? He seems awfully...ordinary.
* How does that change throughout the book as he interacts more with our friends from London Below?
* What about the other characters - Jessica, Door, Marquis de Carabas, Hunter, the Rat-Speakers, Mr. Croup and Vandemar, Islington?

###Setting
* The Marquis de Carabas tells Richard that London Below is "inhabited by the people who fell through the cracks in the world." What does that mean and what do you think of this world?
* How does it compare with other fantastic lands, such as Wonderland and Oz?

###Plot Events
* Why was Richard able to see Door at the beginning of the book?
* What was your thoughts on the Ordeal of the Key?
* What was your reaction to finding out about Islington's true nature, and why is it significant that Stockton owns the Angelus statue?
* What about Richard's decision to return to London Below at the end of the book?
